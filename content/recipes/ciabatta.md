steps:
  - title: "Make the Poolish "
    description: >-
      Special Note:


      The poolish needs 8-12 hours to mature, so make sure to mix it the night before you want to make ciabatta.


      Combine the bread flour, yeast and water in a bowl or container.




      Mix thoroughly with a rubber spatula until there are no dry lumps of flour.




      Cover the bowl with cling wrap and allow it to mature at room temperature overnight (between 8 - 12 hours).
  - title: "Mix the Dough "
    description: >-
      Using a stand mixer with the hook attachment, mix together the poolish,
      water, almond milk, lemon juice, sugar, and oil on first speed for about 1
      minute.




      Add the flour and yeast to the mixer and mix on low speed for about 2 minutes; stopping the mixer after 1 minute to scrape the bowl and make sure all the dry ingredients are hydrated and incorporated into the dough.




      Add the salt to the dough and allow the dough to mix on second speed until a soft, loose, smooth dough forms (about 6-8 minutes).
  - title: "Bulk Ferment "
    description: >-
      Coat a plastic bowl or container with  a thin layer of extra virgin olive
      oil.




      Place the dough in the bowl/container, cover with a lid or plastic wrap and allow the dough to ferment at room temperature for 90 minutes, folding the dough over gently after the first 45 minutes. To turn the dough halfway through fermentation, wet your hand with room temperature water and fold the dough into thirds like you would fold a letter in on itself.
  - title: "Shape the Bread "
    description: >-
      Preheat the oven to 450 º F.




      Heavily flour your work surface creating a roughly 12 inch by 18 inch rectangle of flour.




      Allow dough to spill out onto the floured surface.




      Liberally flour the dough and your hands and gently pat the dough into a large rectangular shape. 




      With a pizza cutter, cut the dough into buns by cutting 4 columns and 3 rows.




      Place the sandwich loaves on 2 separate sheet pans lined with parchment and dusted with cornmeal.
  - title: "Proof the Rolls "
    description: Allow your bread to sit at room temperature for about 20 minutes,
      under a kitchen towel to proof.
  - title: "Bake the Bread "
    description: |-
      Bake for 22-25 minutes.



      After baking, transfer the buns onto cooling racks as quickly as possible.
