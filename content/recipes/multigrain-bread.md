steps:
  - title: "Mixing the Dough "
    description: Using a mixer bowl with a hook attachment, combine warm water,
      agave nectar, bread flour, rye flour, coconut flour, and yeast and mix on
      first speed for 1 minute.
  - title: Add the Mix-Ins
    description: >-
      While the mixer remains on first speed, add the cornmeal, oats and millet
      to the dough and allow to mix for 1 minute.




      While the mixer remains on first speed, add the salt and allow the dough to mix until smooth (about 6 minutes).
  - title: "Bulk Ferment "
    description: Transfer the dough to a greased bowl and cover with plastic wrap
      and allow to bulk ferment at room temperature for 90 minutes.
  - title: "Shape the Bread "
    description: >-
      Preheat the oven to 375ยบ F.




      Turn your dough out onto a clean surface and shape into a boule (or large ball).




      Do this by tucking the edges of the bread underneath in a circular fashion.




      Sprinkle a small amount of corn meal onto a sheet pan lined with parchment paper and place the loaf on the pan.
  - title: "Proof the Bread "
    description: Cover the loaf with a tea towel, or large container if you have
      one, and allow your dough to proof to double the size.
  - title: "Score the Bread "
    description: Once the loaf is ready to bake, dress and score your bread to your
      preference. I like to add a bit of flour and decorative scoring but you
      can also make a mixture of water and agave to brush on the dough before
      adding additional grains such as oats to the outside of the dough.
  - title: "Bake the Bread "
    description: >-
      Bake for 40-45 minutes.




      Rotate your bread in the oven at the 30 minute mark.




      Once the bread has been baked, remove it from the hot sheet pan as quickly as possible and place on a cooling rack.
