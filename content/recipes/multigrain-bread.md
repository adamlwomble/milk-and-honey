    description: >-
      Using a mixer bowl with a hook attachment, combine warm water, agave
      nectar, bread flour, rye flour, coconut flour, and yeast and mix on first
      speed for 1 minute.




      While the mixer remains on first speed, add the cornmeal, oats and millet to the dough and allow to mix for 1 minute.




      While the mixer remains on first speed, add the salt and allow the dough to mix until smooth (about 6 minutes).




      Transfer the dough to a greased bowl and cover with plastic wrap and allow to bulk ferment at room temperature for 90 minutes.




      Preheat the oven to 375ยบ F.




      Turn your dough out onto a clean surface and shape into a boule (or large ball).




      Do this by tucking the edges of the bread underneath in a circular fashion.




      Sprinkle a small amount of corn meal onto a sheet pan lined with parchment paper and place the loaf on the pan.




      Cover the loaf with a tea towel, or large container if you have one, and allow your dough to proof to double the size.




      Once the loaf is ready to bake, dress and score your bread to your preference. I like to add a bit of flour and decorative scoring but you can also make a mixture of water and agave to brush on the dough before adding additional grains such as oats to the outside of the dough.




      Bake for 40-45 minutes.




      Rotate your bread in the oven at the 30 minute mark.




      Once the bread has been baked, remove it from the hot sheet pan as quickly as possible and place on a cooling rack.
