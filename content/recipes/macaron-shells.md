steps:
  - title: "Make the Almond Paste "
    description: >-
      Sift the almond flour and powdered sugar together into a mixing bowl.




      Using a rubber spatula, combine the first quantity of egg whites and vanilla with the almond flour mixture until a thick paste forms. Set aside.
  - title: "Make the Sugar Syrup "
    description: Combine the water and sugar in a saucepan and allow this to cook to
      a syrup until it reaches 248° F.
  - title: "Foam the Egg Whites "
    description: >-
      Place the second quantity of egg whites and a pinch of salt in a mixer
      bowl with a whisk attachment. 


      While the syrup comes to temperature, whisk the egg whites at medium speed until foamy.


      \

      Once the egg whites become foamy, reduce the mixer to low speed until the syrup reaches 248° F.
  - title: "Make the Meringue "
    description: >-
      Once the syrup reaches 248° F, immediately take the syrup off the heat and
      pour it slowly into the egg whites while the mixer is on low speed.




      As you slowly add the hot syrup to the mixer, gradually increase the speed of the mixer until it reaches medium speed; once all the syrup is in the bowl, the mixer should be at medium speed.




      Allow the meringue to whip for 5 minutes or until the bowl is only slightly warm to the touch and the meringue holds a stiff peak.
  - title: "Macronage "
    description: >-
      Fold ⅓ of the meringue into the almond paste until it is evenly
      distributed.




      Fold the second third of meringue into the almond paste being careful to keep as much air in the meringue as possible.




      Fold the last third of the meringue into the almond batter until the mixture looks smooth and resembles the movement of molten lava.
  - title: "Pipe the Shells "
    description: >-
      Transfer the batter into a piping bag with a small or medium tip — I use
      an 806 — and pipe macaron shells onto a sheet pan lined with parchment
      paper.




      Allow the macaron shells to dry at room temperature for 30 minutes, or until the shells are no longer sticky to the touch.
  - title: "Bake the Shells "
    description: >-
      While the shells are drying, preheat the oven to 350° F.




      Bake the shells for 7–10 minutes.




      After removing the shells from the oven, place the entire sheet on a cooling rack and allow the shells and pan to cool completely before removing the shells with a small offset spatula.
