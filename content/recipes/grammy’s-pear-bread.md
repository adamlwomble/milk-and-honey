steps:
  - title: "Make the Almond Streusel Topping "
    description: >-
      Cut the cold butter into small cubes, aim for the size of corn kernels.




      Combine all ingredients in a stand mixer with a paddle attachment on medium-low speed until a sandy consistency is achieved.




      Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator until use.
  - title: "Prep the Oven and Pan "
    description: |-
      Preheat the oven to 350º F.



      Spray a 9”x5” loaf pan with non-stick cooking spray.
  - title: "Prep the Pear "
    description: Prepare the pear by peeling, coring, and then dicing it into small
      cubes and set aside.
  - title: "Measure the Dry Ingredients "
    description: Sift the flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon together into a
      bowl and set aside
  - title: "Mix the Wet Ingredients "
    description: >-
      In a stand mixer with a paddle attachment, combine the egg, brown sugar,
      and sugar on medium speed until the mixture becomes a silky texture with a
      light brown color (about 2-3 minutes).




      Add the buttermilk, oil, and extracts and mix until combine; scrape the bowl half way through mixing to make sure all ingredients are being incorporated evenly.
  - title: "Add the dry ingredients "
    description: >-
      Add the flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon to the wet mixture and mix
      on first speed for about 20 seconds; the mixture should look like lumpy
      oatmeal.




      Scrape the bowl really well to incorporate all dry ingredients that may be clinging to the sides of the bowl or the paddle.




      Mix on second speed until there are no lumps (about 2 minutes).




      Remove the mixer bowl from the stand and fold in the cubed pear.
  - title: "Bake the Bread "
    description: >-
      Fill the loaf pan with the batter and generously sprinkle about ⅓ of the
      streusel on top, make sure you cannot see the wet batter through the
      streusel.




      Bake for 60 minutes or until a cake tester comes out clean.




      Place foil on loaf 45 minutes into baking to reduce over browning the streusel.




      After baking, carefully remove the hot loaf from the pan 10 minutes after baking and transfer to a cooling rack to cool.
