steps:
  - title: "Make the Macaron Shells "
    description: >-
      Prepare the macarons shells by using the macaron shell recipe.




      Replace one ounce (two tablespoons) of powdered sugar with once ounce (two tablespoons) of cocoa powder.




      Bake as instructed.
  - title: "Make the Espresso Syrup "
    description: >-
      Follow the instructions on your espresso instant coffee to make a 6 oz cup
      of espresso.




      Allow the espresso to cool to just slightly warm.




      Transfer the espresso to a small saucepan.




      Add the sugar to the espresso in the saucepan.




      Place saucepan over medium heat and stir constantly until the sugar has completely dissolved.




      Take the espresso syrup off of the heat and allow it to come to room temperature.




      Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator and it will last for up to 1 month.
  - title: "Make the Espresso Buttercream "
    description: >-
      In a stand mixer with a whisk attachment, whip the butter on medium speed
      until it is light and fluffy.




      Sift the powdered sugar, then add ¼ of the sifted powdered sugar to the butter and whip until combined.




      Scrape the inside of the bowl to loosen any dry sugar from the sides of the bowl. 




      Continue to add the powdered sugar to the butter ¼ at a time and scrape the bowl after each addition until a smooth consistency is achieved.




      Once all the sugar has been added,  add the half and half and the espresso syrup and beat until smooth.
  - title: "Finish the Macarons "
    description: >-
      Take some time to match top and bottom shells together to make the best
      match for each sandwich.




      Once a match is found, place the bottom shell (inside up) next to its top shell (inside down).




      In your non-dominant hand, hold the bottom half of the sandwich inside up in your hand.




      With your dominant hand, pipe the buttercream into the sandwich bottom.




      With the top shell of the sandwich in your dominant hand gently press the top shell into the buttercream until the buttercream pushes out to reach the edge of each shell. 




      Enjoy immediately or place in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 7 days.
