steps:
  - title: "Melt the Oil "
    description: |-
      Use a large saucepan with a fitted lid, but leave the lid aside for now.



      Over medium heat, melt the coconut oil.
  - title: "Add the Sugar and Salt "
    description: Once the oil has melted completely add the sugar and salt, then mix
      until the sugar just begins to dissolve.
  - title: "Coat the Popcorn "
    description: >-
      Place a few kernels into the oil; once the oil sizzles and bubbles around
      the kernels it has reached the proper temperature and you may add all the
      kernels to the saucepan.




      With a heat safe rubber spatula, stir the kernels coating each one in the sugary oil mixture.
  - title: "Pop the Popcorn "
    description: >-
      Place the lid on the saucepan and begin moving the pan back and forth over
      the heat source to keep any of the ingredients from burning; keep the
      saucepan moving during the entire popping process.




      Once the popping slows to 1 or 2 pops every second, turn off the heat and slowly remove the lid.




      Slowly pour the kettle corn into a heat safe serving bowl.
