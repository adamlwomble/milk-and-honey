steps:
  - title: Prep your Oven and Pan
    description: >-
      Preheat the oven to 350º F.




      Prepare a 9”x5” loaf pan by spraying generously with a non-stick cooking spray.
  - title: "Measure your Dry Ingredients "
    description: Sift the flour, baking soda, salt, and spices together into a
      mixing bowl and set aside.
  - title: "Mix your wet ingredients "
    description: >-
      Using a stand mixer with a whip attachment, beat the butter, oil, sugar,
      and brown sugar together on second speed until smooth and light (about 2
      minutes).




      Scrape the bowl periodically to ensure all the ingredients are being incorporated evenly.




      Add the pumpkin puree and beat on first speed until smooth (about 1 minute).




      Add the eggs, buttermilk, and vanilla extract and beat on first speed until well combined.
  - title: "Add the dry ingredients "
    description: >-
      Add the flour, baking soda, salt, and spices to the pumpkin mixture and
      beat on first speed for about 20 seconds.




      Scrape the bowl to incorporate all the dry ingredients into the mixture and then mix on medium speed until there are no lumps (about 2 minutes).




      Remove the mixer bowl from the stand and fold in the pecans.
  - title: "Bake the Bread "
    description: >-
      Pour the batter into the loaf pan to ¾ of the way full.




      This recipe usually makes a bit more than needed so, if you have any batter left over, you can bake the bakers portion in a mini-loaf tin or in a muffin tin.




      Bake for 50 - 65 minutes or until a cake tester comes out clean.




      Remove the bread after 10 minutes and transfer to a cooling rack.
