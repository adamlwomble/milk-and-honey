      Special Note:


      Place the frozen peaches in a sieve over a large mixing bowl. Toss the peach slices in the juice of ½ a lemon, cover with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator to thaw overnight. This will allow the peaches to thaw out without browning overnight.




      Instructions:




      In a large saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter.




      Once the butter is melted, add the peach slices (discarding the juice) and saute until the peaches are fully warmed (about 5 minutes).




      Add the brown sugar, cinnamon, salt, and first quantity of water to the saucepan and stir while the sugar dissolves.




      Let this mixture simmer until the peaches become tender, stirring often ( about 6-8 minutes).




      While the preaches are simmering, mix the cornstarch and the second portion of water into a small container beating until smooth.




      Once the peaches are tender, add the cornstarch mixture to the saucepan and stir continuously until the filling becomes thick and begins to boil.




      Remove the saucepan from heat and stir in the vanilla while the filling is hot.




      Pour the filling onto a clean sheet pan and lay cling wrap onto the hot filling then place the sheet pan in the refrigerator to chill.




      Once completely chilled, place the filling in an airtight container and store up to a week in the refrigerator until ready for use.
  - title: "Roll and Cut the Pie Dough "
    description: >-
      Roll the pie dough to ⅛” thickness.




      Using a  5 inch biscuit cutter, cut out mini pie crusts and set them aside on parchment paper for assembly.




      Fold the leftover pie dough onto itself and knead only as much as necessary to bring the dough back together for further use. 




      Reroll the leftover pie dough to ⅛” thickness and repeat the process of cutting mini pie crusts.




      Continue to do this until you’ve used all the dough, this should make about 18 mini pie crusts.




      Throughout this process place the mini pie crusts in the refrigerator to prevent them from getting too warm if needed.
  - title: "Egg wash the Pies "
    description: >-
      Make an egg wash by cracking an egg into a small container with a pinch of
      salt and beat it well.




      Using a small pastry brush, brush the egg wash around the rim of the pie crust.
  - title: "Assemble the Pies "
    description: >-
      Using a spoon or a small ice cream scoop, place about 1.5 ounces of
      filling in the center of the crust.




      While the crust is on a flat work surface, close in the filling by pinching 6 points evenly around the crust. Imagine the mini pie crust as a clock; use both hands to pinch the 3:00 and 9:00 positions together, followed by the 2:00 and 7:00 positions, and finally the 4:00 and 10:00 positions.




      At this stage, looking top down, the pie should have 6 points of closure and resemble a star.




      Moving your egg-washed brush counter clockwise around the pie, brush the 6 flaps with egg wash.




      Pick the pie up; with the bottom of the pie in your left and hand use your right hand to  gently press each flap, egg wash down, at an angle to meet the bottom edge of the pie.




      Repeat this all the way around the pie until you’ve made a hexagon with a small opening at the top to release steam.




      Brush each pie with egg wash then generously sprinkle with sugar.
  - title: "Chill the Pies "
    description: >-
      Once all the pies have been shaped, and egg washed, wrap them in cling
      wrap and place them in the freezer for at least 2 hours.




      This step helps the pies retain their shape while baking.
  - title: "Bake the Pies "
    description: >-
      Once the pies are ready to bake, preheat the oven to 375º F and bake for
      30 - 35 minutes.




      The pies are finished when you see some browning on the edges and bottom as well as a bubbling filling.


       


      After baking, place the hot sheet pan on a cooling rack and allow the pies to rest for 5 minutes before transferring the pies to a cooling rack.
