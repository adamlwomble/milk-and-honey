steps:
  - title: "Brown the Butter "
    description: >-
      Place the butter in a small saucepan and melt over medium heat.




      Continue to let the butter simmer over medium heat until the butter bubbles; continually watch the butter until the bubbles slow and the butter has browned to a caramel color.




      Pour the hot, browned butter into a heat safe bowl and allow to cool to room temperature.
  - title: "Food Process the Kettle Corn "
    description: While the butter cools, place the kettle corn in a food processor
      and pulse until it reaches a consistency of oats; you should have 8 cups
      of food processed kettle corn.
  - title: "Mix the Cookie Dough "
    description: >-
      In a stand mixer with a paddle attachment, cream the brown butter, brown
      sugar, sugar, and salt on second speed until creamy (about 1 minute).




      Scrape the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula to ensure all the ingredients are being incorporated evenly.


       


      Add the egg, vanilla, and dark corn syrup, then mix on second speed until well incorporated(about 30 seconds).




      Scrape the sides of the bowl again to ensure all the ingredients are being incorporated evenly.




      Add the flour, kettle corn, and baking soda, then mix on first speed until the ingredients look almost fully combined, the dough should look like it’s 75% of the way mixed meaning you can see some dry ingredients that aren’t fully incorporated.




      Scrape the sides of the bowl again to release all the dry ingredients that may have stuck to its bottom or sides.
  - title: Add the Mix-Ins
    description: Add the M&M’s and butterscotch chips, then mix on first speed until
      the sides of the bowl look clean and the dough is clinging to the paddle
      (about 1 minute).
  - title: "Rest the Dough "
    description: Transfer your cookie dough to a clean mixing bowl and cover with
      cling wrap, then let the dough rest at room temperature for 30 minutes.
  - title: "Scoop the Cookies "
    description: >-
      With a #16 ice cream scoop (2 ounces, blue handle) portion the cookies
      onto a sheet pan lined with parchment paper.




      Once all the cookies have been scooped, gently press the tops of the cookies with the palm of your hand to flatten the domes just a bit; this helps the cookies to spread evenly while baking.
  - title: "Chill the Cookies "
    description: Cover the unbaked cookies with plastic wrap and store in the
      refrigerator for at least 2 hours or overnight.
  - title: "Bake the Cookies "
    description: >-
      Preheat the oven to 360º F and bake the cookies from a chilled state for
      15-17 minutes.


       


      If your oven has hot spots, rotate your sheer pan 180° after the first 10 minutes.
  - title: "Carry-over Baking "
    description: After removing your cookies from the oven, allow them to sit on the
      hot sheet pan for 5 minutes before transferring them to a cooling rack.
