      First 8 Ingredients 




      Cut the butter into small cubes about the size of corn kernels.


      Add all the ingredients together in a mixer bowl with a paddle attachment and mix on first speed until the streusel reaches a sandy consistency.


      Place in an airtight container and store in the refrigerator until use.
  - title: "Preheat the Oven "
    description: >-
      Preheat the oven to 350º F.




      Prepare a muffin tin by placing liners in the tin and set aside for later use.
  - title: "Mix the Muffin Batter "
    description: >-
      Using a stand mixer with a whip attachment beat butter, sugar, and brown
      sugar together on second speed until smooth and light, scrape the bowl
      periodically to ensure all the ingredients are being incorporated evenly.




      Add pumpkin puree and beat on first speed until smooth.




      Add eggs, buttermilk, and vanilla extract and beat on first speed until well combined.




      Sift flour, baking soda, salt, and spices together and then add them to the pumpkin mixture and beat on first speed for about 20 seconds.




      Scrape the bowl really well to incorporate all the dry ingredients into the mixture and then mix on medium speed until there are no lumps (about 2 minutes).




      Remove the bowl from the stand and fold in the pecans and toffee bits.
