steps:
  - title: "Separate the Dry and Wet Ingredients "
    description: >-
      In a mixing bowl, whisk the bread flour and instant yeast together then
      set aside.




      Place the milk, pineapple juice, brown sugar, and egg in a mixer bowl with a hook attachment.
  - title: "Mix the Dough "
    description: >-
      Add flour and yeast mixture to the mixer and mix on low speed until a
      rough, shaggy dough starts to form (about 1 minute).


       


      Add the salt to the dough slowly while the  mixer remains on first speed.
  - title: "Add the Butter "
    description: >-
      Once all the salt is incorporated, slowly add the room temperature butter;
      about a tablespoon at a time.




      Wait until you can no longer see large pats or streaks of butter before adding more butter, this process should take about 5 minutes.




      Once all the butter has been added to the dough allow it to continue mixing on first speed until a smooth dough forms (about 8-10 minutes).
  - title: "Bulk Ferment "
    description: Transfer the dough to a greased bowl and cover with plastic wrap or
      into a greased airtight container and allow the dough to ferment at room
      temperature for 90 minutes.
  - title: "Portion the Rolls "
    description: Portion the dough into 16 equal pieces (about 3.4 oz each).
  - title: "Chill the Dough "
    description: Roll each piece into a ball and place on a sheet pan lined with
      parchment paper then wrap with cling wrap and place in the refrigerator
      overnight or at least 6 hours.
  - title: "Shape the Rolls "
    description: >-
      Once dough has rested for at least 6 hours, take it out of the
      refrigerator, unwrap, and begin gently rolling each piece in your hands to
      warm it up to room temperature.




      To shape the rolls, roll each ball into a log shape until it is about 8 inches in length and equal thickness from end to end.




      Shape the roll into a knot by grabbing one end of the log with your left hand.




      Use your right hand to guide the log over and around your fingers to create a loop.




      Pull any excess dough through the loop to create a knot.




      Place the roll ugly-side-down on a sheet pan lined with parchment and tuck any excess dough underneath the roll.




      Repeat this process until all of the rolls are formed.
  - title: "Proof the Rolls "
    description: |-
      Allow the rolls to proof until doubled in size (about 70-90 minutes).



      While the loaves are proving, preheat the oven to 375º F.
  - title: "Bake the Rolls "
    description: Egg wash each roll and bake at 375º F for 25 - 30 minutes.
