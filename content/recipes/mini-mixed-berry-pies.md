steps:
  - title: "Make the Pie Dough "
    description: Make the Pie Dough as instructed
  - title: "Prep the Berries "
    description: Place the frozen berries in a sieve over a large mixing bowl, cover
      with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator to thaw overnight. This
      will allow the juice to drain from the berries while they thaw out. Make
      sure to reserve the juice for the rest of the pie filling. If your berries
      do not produce the full amount of juice needed, you can supplement with a
      berry juice of your choice. I like to use cranberry or pineapple juice.
  - title: "Make a Berry Jelly "
    description: >-
      In a saucepan over medium-high heat, bring the berry juice and first
      quantity of sugar to a boil.




      While the juice comes to a boil, mix the cornstarch and water together in a small container and beat until smooth.




      Once the juice is boiling, add the cornstarch mixture to the saucepan and stir until the mixture bubbles and thickens (about 2 minutes).
  - title: "Make the Filling "
    description: >-
      Remove the saucepan from the heat and add the second quantity of sugar,
      salt, and lemon juice and mix until combined.




      Add the fully thawed berries into the saucepan and fold them gently into the jelly mixture.
  - title: "Chill the Filling "
    description: >-
      Place the filling onto a clean sheet pan and cover with cling wrap then
      place in the refrigerator to chill before use.




      Once the filling is fully chilled, place in an airtight container and store in the refrigerator until ready for use, up to a week.
  - title: "Roll the Pie Dough "
    description: >-
      Roll the pie dough to ⅛” thickness.




      Using a  5 inch biscuit cutter, cut out mini pie crusts and set them aside on parchment paper for assembly.




      Fold the leftover pie dough onto itself and knead only as much as necessary to bring the dough back together for further use. 




      Reroll the leftover pie dough to ⅛” thickness and repeat the process of cutting mini pie crusts.




      Continue to do this until you’ve used all the dough, this should make about 18 mini pie crusts.




      Throughout this process place the mini pie crusts in the refrigerator to prevent them from getting too warm if needed.
  - title: "Prep the Mini Pies "
    description: >-
      Make an egg wash by cracking an egg into a small container with a pinch of
      salt and beat it well.




      Using a small pastry brush, brush the egg wash around the rim of the pie crust.
  - title: "Assemble the Mini Pies "
    description: >-
      Using a spoon or a small ice cream scoop, place about 1.5 ounces of
      filling in the center of the crust.




      While the crust is on a flat work surface, close in the filling by pinching 6 points evenly around the crust. Imagine the mini pie crust as a clock; use both hands to pinch the 3:00 and 9:00 positions together, followed by the 2:00 and 7:00 positions, and finally the 4:00 and 10:00 positions.




      At this stage, looking top down, the pie should have 6 points of closure and resemble a star.




      Moving your egg-washed brush counter clockwise around the pie, brush the 6 flaps with egg wash.




      Pick the pie up; with the bottom of the pie in your left and hand use your right hand to  gently press each flap, egg wash down, at an angle to meet the bottom edge of the pie.




      Repeat this all the way around the pie until you’ve made a hexagon with a small opening at the top to release steam.




      Brush each pie with egg wash then generously sprinkle with sugar.

    description: >-
      Once all the pies have been shaped, and egg washed, wrap them in cling
      wrap and place them in the freezer for at least 2 hours.




      This step helps them retain their shape while baking.
  - title: Bake the Pies
    description: >-
      Once the pies are ready to bake, preheat the oven to 375º F and bake for
      30 - 35 minutes.




      The pies are finished when you see some browning on the edges and bottom as well as a bubbling filling.


       


      After baking, place the hot sheet pan on a cooling rack and allow the pies to rest for 5 minutes before transferring the pies to a cooling rack.
