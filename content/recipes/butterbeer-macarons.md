steps:
  - title: "Make the Macaron Shells "
    description: >-
      Prepare the macarons shells by using the macaron shell recipe.




      If a richer flavor is desired, replace the vanilla extract with rum extract.




      Bake as instructed.
  - title: "Make the Buttercream "
    description: >-
      In a microwave safe bowl, melt the butterscotch chips in the microwave in
      10 second intervals, mixing between each interval until the chips are
      fully melted and have a smooth texture.




      In a stand mixer with a whisk attachment, whip the butter on medium speed until it is light and fluffy.




      Add the melted butterscotch chips to the butter and whip on medium speed until fully combined with butter.




      Sift the powdered sugar and ¼ of the sifted powdered sugar to the butter and whip until combined.




      Scrape the inside of the bowl to fully incorporate all the sugar.




      Continue to add the sugar to the butter ¼ at a time and scrape the bowl after each addition until a smooth consistency is achieved.




      Once all the sugar has been added,  add the heavy cream and the vanilla extract and beat until smooth.

    description: >-
      Take some time to match top and bottom shells together to make the best
      match for each sandwich.




      Once a match is found, place the bottom shell (inside up) next to its top shell (inside down).




      In your non-dominant hand, hold the bottom half of the sandwich inside up in your hand.




      With your dominant hand, pipe the buttercream into the sandwich bottom.




      With the top shell of the sandwich in your dominant hand gently press the top shell into the buttercream until the buttercream pushes out to reach the edge of each shell. 




      Fill a small bowl or plate with sanding sugar.




      Turn the sandwich sideways so the buttercream is exposed to the sanding sugar and roll the sandwich to coat the exposed buttercream with sanding sugar. 




      Do this to each sandwich to create a frothy look.




      Enjoy immediately or place in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 7 days.
