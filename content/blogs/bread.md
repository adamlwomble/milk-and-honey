Hello, Bakers and welcome to my first bread blog! There’s so much I’ve learned about bread over the last 6 years or so, but I certainly don’t want to overwhelm any of you with all of it in one blog. My intention with this particular post is to simply give you some foundational tips and techniques that will give you a bit of confidence when making bread at home. A lofty goal, I know. But, at yeast I have goals. Get it? Yeast...Ok, let’s get to it.

First, let’s differentiate between some common types of bread. There’s quick bread which is usually leavened with baking soda. The internet says North America is the place of origin of this type of bread, but most folks relate it to “Irish Soda Bread.” Another type of bread that can be leavened, unleavened, or even fried are flat breads like Naan, Tortillas, and Pita.

The last type of bread I’ll mention will also be the focus of this blog: yeasted breads. These breads are, you guessed it, leavened with yeast. Whether you use a natural yeast starter, active-dry yeast or instant yeast, these are the breads you’re probably thinking of when you daydream about making bread at home. Yeasted breads also include enriched breads. These breads are enriched with luxurious ingredients like eggs, milk, butter, and sugar to make a silky, almost cake-like texture in breads like challah and brioche. 

Although I’ll be discussing yeasted breads, I will save natural yeast leavened breads like sourdough for another time and focus on breads leavened with yeast you can buy from the store. Let’s get started with my first tip which is to remember to *Mise en Place*. In short, measure out all your ingredients ahead of time, read through the recipe and prepare any bowls, scrapers, and any other tools you may need. 

When it comes to mixing bread dough I typically use a stand mixer with a hook attachment. If you don’t have a stand mixer, but want to follow my bread recipes, know that hand kneading may require you to double the mix time you’ll find in the recipes. 

When a bread recipe requires salt, never place the salt directly onto the yeast. This may cause the yeast to deactivate and prohibit your bread from rising. Instead, I like to get all the ingredients in the mixer bowl and add the salt after the mixer is already on. This gives the yeast a head start in the dough before salt is introduced. 

When it comes to proofing your dough at home there are a lot of techniques. My favorite way to proof bread at home is in a warm oven. What I do is place a large casserole dish in my oven and begin preheating the oven to the lowest temperature. I watch the oven temperature and once it reaches 100º F I turn the oven off. While the oven and pan inside are warming up I boil some water either on the stove or in the microwave. Once it’s time to proof my bread, I place the bread on the top rack of the oven and pour the boiling water into the warmed casserole pan on the bottom rack and close the oven. The warm, humid environment is a great catalyst for the yeast to...ya know...prove itself. That’s probably not my last bread pun. Sorry, not sorry.

If that proofing method is a little too finicky for you, I totally get it. I’ve also had success proofing bread on top of my dryer. Let me explain; I wet a large towel like a beach towel and place it in the dryer. I then set the dryer to tumble on low heat and simply place my bread on top of the dryer while the towel dries. If your dryer is in a small utility room or closet then the warmth and humidity of this spot should be a good environment for your bread to rise. 

One last proofing at home method is using a heating pad. This is the simplest home proof method, but can still be effective. All you do for this method is place your bread on top of a heating pad set to medium heat. You can place a tea towel on the bread or trap the heat by placing a large container upside down over the bread and heating pad. Try out these methods and see what works best for you and your kitchen.

A good question following proofing methods would be: How do I know if I’ve proofed by bread successfully? The answer is the poke test. Gently poke your bread with a finger. If your bread springs back all the way, it needs more time to prove. If your bread doesn’t spring back at all, it’s overproofed. What you want is something in between. A perfectly proofed loaf with spring back to about 75% of its indentation. One thing I will mention here is when using my favorite proofing method I look for about 50% spring back. This is because my bread will continue to proof after I remove it from the warm oven to preheat it for the actual bake. The bread will finish proofing at room temperature while my oven takes 15-20 minutes to preheat to the required baking temperature. 

Now, time to bake! You may ask, “How do I know my bread is fully baked?” You can actually take the internal temperature with a thermometer like you would with cooking meat. Yeasted breads are fully baked around 190º F. The other way to know if your bread is baked properly is the sound test. Turn your baked bread upside down in one hand. With the other hand, knock on the bottom of the bread as if you were knocking on a door. The bread should sound hollow. I think of trying to find studs in the wall. There’s a sort of dead, staccato, sound when you knock on a stud rather than between the studs. The dead sound indicates raw dough in the middle of the bread where fully baked bread will have an airy crust inside giving you the hollow sound you’re looking for. 

Lastly, and this is maybe just personal advice, don’t cut into your bread for at least 30 minutes. Like meat, the bread needs to rest before cutting and serving. The big exception, at least when discussing yeasted bread is rolls. Dig into those rolls while they’re warm! Thank you for reading and happy baking!
