steps:
  - title: "Mix the Dough "
    description: In a stand mixer with a hook attachment, combine all the
      ingredients on low speed until a smooth dough is formed (about 3-5
      minutes).
  - title: "Portion the Tortillas "
    description: >-
      Portion the dough into 9 equal-sized pieces (about 2.8 ounces each) then
      shape each piece into a smooth ball.




      Place the dough balls to rest on a lightly floured surface, under a tea towel for 20 minutes.
  - title: Prepare to Cook Tortillas
    description: |-
      While the dough is resting heat the cast iron skillet over medium heat.



      Lightly flour your work surface and your rolling pin.
  - title: "Rolling the Tortillas "
    description: >-
      Press a dough ball into the work surface with the palm of your hand to
      flatten it into a thick, round, disc shape.




      With your rolling pin in the middle of the tortilla, roll away from yourself towards the top edge of the tortilla.




      Return to the middle of the tortilla and roll towards yourself towards the bottom of the tortilla; creating an oblong/oval shape.




      Turn the tortilla 90 degrees and starting in the middle roll towards the top of the tortilla.




      Return the rolling pin to the middle to roll towards the bottom of the tortilla.




      Flip the tortilla on the work surface and repeat the rolling process on the opposite side until you have a tortilla that is roughly 9 inches in diameter and an even thickness all over; about ⅛ inch thick.
  - title: "Cook the Tortillas "
    description: >-
      Lay a tortilla flat in the skillet for even cooking.




      Watch closely for air bubbles to start appearing.




      Once the air bubbles have stopped expanding, flip the tortilla to cook on the other side with a pair of tongs.




      The whole process takes about 45-75 seconds on either side depending on your stove top and skillet.


       


      Repeat this process until all your tortillas are done.
