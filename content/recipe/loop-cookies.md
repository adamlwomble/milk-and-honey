steps:
  - title: "Cream the Fat "
    description: >-
      In a stand mixer with a paddle attachment, combine the oil, sugar, and
      eggs at second speed until ingredients look evenly mixed (about 1 minute).




      Scrape the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula to ensure all the ingredients are being incorporated evenly.
  - title: "Add the Lemon Juice "
    description: >-
      Strain the lemon juice with a sieve to remove any pulp, then add it to the
      mixer and mix on second speed for about 1 minute.




      Scrape the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula to ensure all the ingredients are being incorporated evenly.
  - title: "Add the Dry Ingredients "

      Zest the Lemon


      Add the flour, baking soda,  baking powder, salt, lemon zest, and poppy seed to the wet mixture, then mix on first speed until the dough should look like it’s 75% of the way mixed, meaning you can see some dry ingredients that aren’t fully incorporated.




      Scrape the sides of the bowl again to release all the dry ingredients that may have stuck to its bottom or sides.




      Continue mixing the dough on first speed for 1 minute, the finished dough should mimic a thick hummus texture.
  - title: "Rest the Dough "
    description: Transfer the cookie dough to a clean mixing bowl and cover it with
      cling wrap, then let the dough chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.
  - title: "Scoop the Cookies "
    description: >-
      With a #16 ice cream scoop (2 ounces, blue handle) portion the cookies
      onto a sheet pan lined with parchment paper.




      Once all the cookies have been scooped, gently press the tops of the cookies with the palm of your hand to flatten the domes just a bit; this helps the cookies to spread evenly while baking.




      Sprinkle each cookie with a dash of sanding sugar.
  - title: "Chill the Cookies "
    description: Cover the unbaked cookies with plastic wrap and store in the
      refrigerator for at least 2 hours, or overnight.
  - title: "Bake the Cookies "
    description: >-
      Preheat the oven to 360º F and bake the cookies from a chilled state for
      14-17 minutes.




      If your oven has hot spots, rotate your sheer pan 180° after the first 10 minutes.
  - title: "Carry-over Baking "
    description: After removing your cookies from the oven, allow them to sit on the
      hot sheet pan for 5 minutes before transferring them to a cooling rack.
