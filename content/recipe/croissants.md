steps:
  - title: "Make the Poolish "
    description: >-
      Combine the first quantities of flour, yeast and water in a medium,
      airtight container, about 1 quart 


      Mix thoroughly with a rubber spatula until there are no dry spots


      Cover the poolish with an airtight lid or plastic wrap if you don’t have a container and allow to ferment at room temperature overnight, 8-12 hours
  - title: "Mix the Croissant Dough "
    description: >-
      In a stand mixer with a hook attachment mix the flour, sugar, yeast, and
      butter on first speed until the butter is evenly distributed


      Add the entire poolish and start the mixer on first speed


      Slowly add water to the mixture while the mixer remains on


      Once all the water has been added, allow to mix on low for 2 minutes


      While the mixer remains on, add the salt slowly to the dough


      Once all the salt has been added allow the dough to mix on first speed for 15 minutes
  - title: "Ferment the Croissant Dough "
    description: Transfer the dough to a greased container and cover with plastic
      wrap or an airtight lid and ferment at room temperature for 30 minutes
  - title: "Chill the Croissant Dough "
    description: After the 30 minutes is up, place the container in your
      refrigerator and allow to finish fermentation overnight for 8-12 hours
  - title: "Make the Butter Block "
    description: >-
      On the same day you make the croissant dough, set the butter for the
      butter block out on the kitchen counter to allow it to come to room
      temperature overnight 


      On the day you plan to laminate and bake the croissants, prepare the butter block by tracing a 6 ¾” x 7 ½” rectangle onto parchment paper 


      Shape the butter into the rectangle with gloved hands taking care to make the butter is an even thickness


      Once you have your butter block shaped, wrap it in the parchment paper and set it in the freezer for about 3 minutes to chill it to about 67F
  - title: "Laminate the Croissant Dough "
    description: >-
      Take out the butter block and check the temperature with a thermometer to
      make sure it is between 66F - 68F


      Flour your work surface and rolling pin and shape your croissant dough into a rectangle measuring 16” x 7 ½” at ½” thickness and allow your dough to come to 55F


      Once both your butter block and dough have reached their ideal temperatures, lamination can begin


      Place your butter block in the middle of your dough, stretch and fold the sides of the dough into the middle and pinch together to seal 


      Using a rolling pin, start in the middle and roll up the dough, returning to the middle to roll down the seam to achieve a 22” x 9” rectangle


      Turn the dough 90 degrees if needed in order to widen to 9”, but keep the seam up


      Once you’ve achieved your rectangle, fold the dough into thirds closing the seam into your first book fold 


      Place your dough on a sheet pan with parchment and allow to rest for 20 - 30 minutes in the refrigerator 


      Repeat the steps of rolling the dough into a 22” x 9” rectangle and folding into a book for a total of 3 times with 20-30 minute rests in between
  - title: "Shape the Croissants "
    description: >-
      Preheat the oven to 370º F


      Roll the croissant dough out to 20” x 9”


      With a ruler and a small knife, place a small mark every 3 inches on one long side of the dough


      Do the same thing on the other side of the dough, but start 1 ½ inches from the edge of the dough


      Place the ruler diagonally across the dough from one makr to another and use it as a straight edge to cut the dough with a pizza cutter


      You should end up with isosceles triangles


      Starting with the large end, roll the dough up towards the smaller edge to create the classic croissant shape
  - title: "Bake the Croissants "
    description: >-
      Proof the croissants by placing them in your oven, heat off, with a pan of
      boiling water


      Egg wash the croissants and bake for 20 - 25 minutes
