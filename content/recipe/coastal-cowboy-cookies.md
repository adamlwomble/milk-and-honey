steps:
  - description: >-
      Place the pecans on a sheet pan and spread them evenly to toast


      Broil the pecans on medium-high heat until fragrant (5-7 minutes), then set aside to cool
    title: "Toast the Pecans "
  - title: "Cream the butter and sugar "
    description: >-
      In a stand mixer with a paddle attachment, cream the butter, brown sugar,
      sugar, and salt on second speed until the mixture appears fluffy (about 2
      minutes)


      Scrape the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula to ensure all the ingredients are being incorporated evenly
  - title: "Additional creaming "
    description: >-
      Add the egg and vanilla, then mix on second speed until fully combined
      (about 30 seconds)


      Scrape the sides of the bowl again to ensure all the ingredients are being incorporated evenly
  - title: "Add the Dry Ingredients "
    description: >-
      Add the flour, oats, baking soda, and cinnamon to the bowl, then mix on
      first speed for about 30 seconds, or until almost fully combined; the
      dough should look like it’s 75% of the way mixed, meaning you can see some
      dry ingredients that aren’t fully incorporated


      Scrape the sides of the bowl again to release all the dry ingredients that may have stuck to its bottom or sides
  - description: Add the rest of the ingredients, then mix on first speed until the
      sides of the bowl look clean and the dough is clinging to the paddle
      (about 1 minute)
    title: Add the Mix-ins
  - title: "Rest the Dough "
    description: Transfer your cookie dough to a clean mixing bowl and cover it with
      cling wrap, then let the dough rest at room temperature for 30 minutes
  - title: "Scoop the Cookies "
    description: >-
      With a #16 ice cream scoop (2 ounces, blue handle) portion the cookies
      onto a sheet pan lined with parchment paper


      Once all the cookies have been scooped, gently press the tops of the cookies with the palm of your hand to flatten the domes just a bit; this helps the cookies spread evenly while baking


      Sprinkle each cookie with a dash of sea salt
  - title: "Bake the Cookies "
    description: >-
      Preheat the oven to 360° F and bake the cookies from a chilled state for
      15–17 minutes


      If your oven has hot spots, rotate your sheet pan 180° after the first 10 minutes
  - title: "Chill the Cookies "
    description: Cover the unbaked cookies with plastic wrap and store in the
      refrigerator for at least 2 hours, or overnight
  - title: "Carry-over baking "
    description: After removing your cookies from the oven, allow them to sit on the
      hot sheet pan for 5 minutes before transferring them to a cooling rack
