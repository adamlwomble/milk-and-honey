    description: >-
      Place the pineapple in a strainer over a bowl to drain juices, this can be
      done overnight in the fridge to save time.




      Peel the carrots then use a box grater to grate 2 cups or 8 ounces worth of carrots, this was 2 large carrots for me.




      Place chopped walnuts on  a sheet pan and broil on high for about 5 minutes or until they become aromatic.

      Prepare a muffin tin with paper liners.



      Preheat the oven to 350º F.
  - title: "Mix the Muffin Batter "
    description: >-
      In a stand mixer with a whip attachment, combine the oil, applesauce, and
      vanilla extract and mix on medium low speed for 2 minutes, scrape the bowl
      to make sure the ingredients are being incorporated.




      Add the dry ingredients the the mixer and mix on medium-low speed until it looks like the mixture looks to be 75% done, it should look a bit lumpy with some dry patches.




      Stop the mixer and scrape the bowl to make sure all the dry ingredients are blended.




      Add the walnuts, coconut, carrots, and pineapple to the mixer and mix on low speed for 2 minutes.
