steps:
  - title: "Cream the Butter and Sugar "
    description: >-
      In a stand mixer with a paddle attachment, cream the butter, brown sugar,
      sugar, and salt on second speed for about 1 minute.




      Scrape the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula to ensure all the ingredients are being incorporated evenly; look for any streaks of butter and make sure the butter is fully incorporated before moving forward or you may end up with cookies that spread unevenly during baking.
  - title: "Additional Creaming "
    description: >-
      Add the eggs and vanilla, then mix on second speed for about 30 seconds.




      Scrape the sides of the bowl again to ensure all the ingredients are being incorporated evenly, then increase the mixer to medium speed for 1 minute.
  - title: "Add the Dry Ingredients "
    description: >-
      Add the flour and baking soda, then mix on first speed until the
      ingredients look almost fully combined, the dough should look like it’s
      75% of the way mixed, meaning you can see some dry ingredients that aren’t
      fully incorporated.




      Scrape the sides of the bowl again to release all the dry ingredients that may have stuck to its bottom or sides.




      Finish mixing the dough on first speed for about 1 minute.
  - title: "Rest the Dough "
    description: Transfer the cookie dough to a clean mixing bowl and cover with
      cling wrap, then let the dough chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.
  - title: "Make the Cinnamon Sugar "
    description: While your dough chills, mix the cinnamon sugar in a separate bowl
      and set aside for later.
  - title: "Scoop the Cookies "
    description: >-
      With a #16 ice cream scoop (2 ounces, blue handle) portion the cookies
      onto a sheet pan lined with parchment paper




      Once all the cookies have been scooped, roll them in the cinnamon sugar generously coating each cookie, then place them back on the sheet pan.
  - title: "Chill the Cookies "
    description: Cover unbaked cookies with plastic wrap and store in the
      refrigerator for at least 2 hours or overnight
  - title: "Bake the Cookies "
    description: >-
      Preheat the oven to 360º F and bake the cookies from a chilled state for
      14-17 minutes.




      If your oven has hot spots, rotate your sheer pan 180° after the first 10 minutes.
  - title: "Carry-over Baking "
    description: After removing your cookies from the oven, allow them to sit on the
      hot sheet pan for 5 minutes before transferring them to a cooling rack.
